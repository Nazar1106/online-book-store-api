   - I can see them, I have searched books, but book shouldn't generate automatically.
   todo: DONE
2) My swagger methods don't work correctly. I have found problems in:
   - Category: My admin can't create new category because Forbidden mistake; Why if I have
   passed token correctly?
   todo: DONE
3) Added appropriate case message to exception handlers and exceptions. Because when I get exception
I don't know about reason.
