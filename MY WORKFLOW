PROBLEMS ISSUES:
1) How can I realise relation in this project? (I have problem with relation in User class). todo DONE


Common mistakes
1) Ensure the correct sequence of script execution. For example, think what table should be created first:
users_roles or roles? - todo DONE
2) In the users_roles table ensure columns together form a composite key - todo DONE
3) Be sure you have created at least one user with the role 'admin' as specified in the task requirements. - todo DONE
4) Ensure that all users created by the Liquibase scripts have some role (or roles). - todo DONE
5) When adding users in the Liquibase script, avoid inserting unhashed passwords such as '1234'. - todo DONE
6) Think about how we should add columns like is_deleted. Should we add them directly to existing scripts
or there is another better way?
7) Verify that alterations or additions to the table structure maintain data integrity and consistency.
8) Think if is it ok to hardcode identifiers in the Liquibase scripts? What is the difference between
value and valueComputed in the YML scripts?
